tb_core_int_datapath PASS
```

Coverage intent met:

- Immediate ALU writeback.
- Register-register ALU writeback.
- Adjacent dependency through staged regfile timing.
- LUI and AUIPC writeback.
- Taken and not-taken branch behavior.
- JAL and JALR link writeback.
- Redirect response blocking, younger-instruction flush, and redirected PC.
- x0, illegal, unsupported, and NOP suppression.
- Fetch PC stepping.
